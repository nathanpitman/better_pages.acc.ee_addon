Better Pages
=========================

This accessory adds extra page/entry data to the native ExpressionEngine Pages module list view. At present this includes additional columns for:

* Entry ID
* Title
* Status
* Template 

In time I plan to add 'sorting' to the data table to make it easier to work with sites with large numbers of static pages.
