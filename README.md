Better Pages for ExpressionEngine
=========================

This accessory adds extra page/entry data to the native ExpressionEngine Pages module list view using AJAX calls. It's quick and dirty but it does the job. At present the accessory addss extra columns for:

* Entry ID
* Title
* Status
* Template Group / Template Name

In time I plan to reduce the code to one AJAX call as opposed to one for each table row and add 'sorting' to the data table to make it easier to work with sites with large numbers of static pages.

This is very much a 'work in progress'!
